-- Q1. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?
-- 0 because null comparison is unkown
 --    SELECT COUNT(*) 
 --    FROM firsttab AS ft 
	-- WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM secondtab WHERE id IS NULL )

-- Q2. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?
-- 2, for the same reason but only one null value is compared vs all of them, and the 5 is excluded
    -- SELECT COUNT(*) 
    -- FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 )


-- Q3. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?
-- 0 for the same reason as Q1
--     SELECT COUNT(*) 
--     FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab )


-- Q4. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?
-- 2, since that's the same as Q2
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )
