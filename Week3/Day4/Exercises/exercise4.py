# Recap – What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
# Floats are non-integer numbers. Integers are precise, whereas floating point numbers can sometime cause errors due to the way precision and numbers after the period are treated
# Create a list containing the following sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 (don’t hard-code the sequence).
float_list =[]
for i in range(3, 10):
    to_append = .5 * i
    float_list.append(.5 * i)
print(float_list)
# Can you think of another way to generate a sequence of floats?
# There are a near infinite number of ways to generate floats? I'm not really sure what this is looking for. You could use a random generator, for one thing.
